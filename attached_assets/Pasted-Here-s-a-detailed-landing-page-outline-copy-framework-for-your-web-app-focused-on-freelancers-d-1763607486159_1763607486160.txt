📐 Trust & Conversion Best Practices
	•	Use a clear UVP (headline + sub-headline) at the top.  ￼
	•	Show real product screenshots, not just generic images.  ￼
	•	Keep layout clean, minimize distractions, one main CTA.  ￼
	•	Provide strong social proof and security statements to build trust.
	•	Optimize for mobile (nomads often use phones).
	•	Use simple, benefit-focused language (avoid heavy jargon).
