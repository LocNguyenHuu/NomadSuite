🎨 UI/UX & Visual Guidelines for Replit Developer
	•	Color palette: Clean, modern, travel-friendly. Suggest: Navy (#1F2D3D), Teal (#00BFA6), Light Grey (#F5F7FA), White (#FFFFFF)
	•	Typography: Sans-serif, e.g., Inter or Poppins.
	•	Visual hierarchy: Use large bold headline in hero, sub-headline smaller; sections clearly separated with whitespace.
	•	Images/Icons: Use dashboard screenshots of NomadSuite or mockups of travel log visuals; icons for features.
	•	Charts: Use subtle animation on scroll, but keep load time under 2 seconds.
	•	Responsiveness: Mobile friendly (nomads often browse on phones). Ensure hero CTA remains visible above fold on mobile.
	•	Micro-interactions: Smooth hover states on buttons, subtle animations for charts when scrolled into view.
	•	Scannability: Use bullet lists, icons, short paragraphs, large margins.
	•	Trust & security cues: Use padlock icons, badge icons for compliance, country flags for global reach.

	•	Create reusable components: FeatureCard, TestimonialCard, PricingTier, ChartWidget.
	•	For charts use lightweight library (e.g., Chart.js or Recharts) with placeholder data.
