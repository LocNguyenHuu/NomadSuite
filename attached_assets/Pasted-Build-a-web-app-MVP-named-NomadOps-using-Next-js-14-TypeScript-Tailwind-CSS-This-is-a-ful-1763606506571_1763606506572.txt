Build a web app MVP named **NomadOps** using Next.js 14 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS.  
This is a full‐stack web application (not mobile app) for freelancers & digital nomads that combines:

1. A **lightweight CRM** for solo freelancers.  
2. **Invoicing & payment tracking** (basic).  
3. A **travel/residency & visa tracker** (for nomads).  
4. A **document vault** with metadata extraction.

### Tech stack:
- Frontend + backend via Next.js (App Router)  
- React + Tailwind CSS for UI  
- PostgreSQL (via Prisma ORM) for database  
- Authentication via NextAuth (email/password + Google OAuth)  
- File storage for documents (S3 or similar)  
- Use OpenAI API for document metadata extraction (stubbed if needed)

### User flows / pages:

#### Public:
- `/` : Landing page with headline, value prop, “Sign Up / Log In” CTA  
- `/login` : Login page  
- `/register` : Signup page  

#### Protected (authenticated):
- `/app/dashboard` : Home screen with summary of clients, open invoices, travel/residency status, alerts  
- `/app/clients` : List of clients (name, email, country, status) + “Add Client”  
- `/app/clients/[id]` : Client detail page (contact info + timeline + invoices)  
- `/app/invoices` : Invoice list with status (Draft, Sent, Paid, Overdue)  
- `/app/invoices/new` : Create invoice page  
- `/app/travel` : Travel log list & form (country, entry date, exit date) + residency calculation widget  
- `/app/visas` : Visa/permit list + form (country, type, issue date, expiry date) + alerts  
- `/app/documents` : Document vault (upload PDF/JPG/PNG) + list with metadata (type, country, expiry)  
- `/app/settings` : Profile settings (name, nationality, home country, currency) + Data export (CSV)  

### Data models (simplified):
- User { id, email, name, nationality, homeCountry, currency, createdAt }  
- Client { id, userId, name, email, country, status, notes, createdAt }  
- Invoice { id, userId, clientId, number, currency, items (JSON), total, vatRate?, status, dueDate, issuedAt }  
- Trip { id, userId, country, entryDate, exitDate, createdAt }  
- Visa { id, userId, country, visaType, issueDate, expiryDate, notes, createdAt }  
- Document { id, userId, type, country?, fileUrl, issueDate?, expiryDate?, label?, createdAt }

### Core features:
- Authentication & profile setup wizard (nation, home country, currency)  
- Dashboard showing key metrics: active clients, open invoices, travel/residency status (183-day rule + Schengen 90/180)  
- Client list + pipeline board (Lead → Proposal → Active → Completed)  
- Invoice creation + PDF export + mark as sent/paid + overdue reminders  
- Travel log with day counting per country + residency risk indicator  
- Schengen 90/180 calculator  
- Visa list + expiry alerts  
- Document upload + metadata extraction via OpenAI + automatic expiry alerts  
- Data export (CSV) for clients, invoices, trips, visas, documents  
- Mobile-responsive UI  

### Non-functional requirements:
- JWT session management  
- Secure storage for documents (AES-256 at rest)  
- Application loads <300ms for dashboard  
- Role: only one role (user) in MVP  
- Simple deployment (hosting on Replit)  

### Build plan:
1. Implement authentication + profile wizard  
2. Build dashboard skeleton  
3. Build CRM (client list + detail)  
4. Build invoice module  
5. Build travel/residency tracker  
6. Build visa module  
7. Build document vault + metadata extraction  
8. QA + mobile responsive + publish
