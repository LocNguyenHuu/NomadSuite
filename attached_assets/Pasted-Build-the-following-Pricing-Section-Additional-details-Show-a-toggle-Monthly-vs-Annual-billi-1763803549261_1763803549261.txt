•	The pricing table should appear horizontally on desktop, stacked vertically on mobile.
•	Use visual highlight (colour, border, badge) for the PRO plan.
•	The hero section should include imagery or background that evokes remote/global mobility, digital nomads.
•	Smooth scroll navigation from hero CTAs to sections.
•	Form(s) are centered, with clear labels and placeholders; mobile-friendly.
