Feature: Expense + Geo-Tagging Module — Web (MVP) User stories: 1. As a logged-in user, I want to add a new expense with date, amount, currency, category, description, optionally attach a receipt and optionally capture my location — so I can track business expenses per project/client. 2. As a logged-in user, I want to view all my expenses in a list/table, with filters by date, project/client, category, location, currency. 3. As a logged-in user, I want to view a summary dashboard: total expenses per time period, and optionally per project/client. 4. As a logged-in user, I want to export my expense data (including receipt links and geo-location) as CSV or JSON (or PDF) for tax/accounting. 5. As a logged-in user, when I choose to attach location, the system should request browser geolocation permission; if granted, store latitude, longitude, (optionally reverse-geocode to city/country); if denied or not available, allow manual entry of location (city, country). Data model (example): TABLE expenses: - id (primary key, UUID) - user_id (foreign key) - date (date) - amount (decimal) - currency (string) - category (string) - description (string, optional) - project_client_id (nullable foreign key) - receipt_url (nullable string) - geo_latitude (nullable float) - geo_longitude (nullable float) - geo_place (nullable string)  // e.g. “Berlin, Germany” - created_at (timestamp) - updated_at (timestamp) API endpoints: - POST /api/expenses  — create new expense - GET /api/expenses — list expenses (with query params for filters) - GET /api/expenses/{id} — get expense detail - DELETE /api/expenses/{id} — delete expense - PUT /api/expenses/{id} — update expense (optional) - GET /api/expenses/export?format=csv|json — export expenses Frontend components: - ExpenseForm: form to enter expense + upload receipt + optional “Add Location” toggle - ExpenseList: table / list of expenses with filters - ExpenseDashboard: shows summary (total per period, optionally per project/client) - ExportButton: triggers export Geo-tagging logic: - On ExpenseForm, if “Add Location” is toggled ON: -> call `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` -> on success: capture lat, long, optionally send to reverse-geocode API to get place/country -> on failure or user denies: user can manually enter location (city, country) Receipt storage: - Use cloud storage AWS S3? to store receipt files - Store the returned URL in `receipt_url` field Access control: - Only allow access to expenses for authenticated user - Sanitize and validate user input (amount > 0, currency in allowed list, file size limit for receipts) Security & Privacy: - Secure file uploads — scan for malicious files - Ensure geo-permission request is explicit, and privacy notice shown (“Do you allow this site to access your location to tag your expense?”) - Store minimal required info; allow user to edit or remove geo data manually (e.g. if incorrect) Milestones: - expense manual entry + receipt upload + list + summary + export (no geo) - currency handling + multi-currency support + FX snapshot if invoice logic shared - geo-tagging optional + location manual fallback + map-view / location filter - advanced reporting per project/client + net profitability view (income – expenses) Dependencies: - User auth module (existing) - Project/Client module (existing) - Invoice module (existing) - File storage / uploads - Database migrations / schema Testing: - Frontend UI tests (form validations, geo permission flow, fallback manual entry)
